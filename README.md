## ðŸ’… Styling with Tailwind CSS

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for fast, utility-first styling.

Tailwind was installed and configured using the [official Vite guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite):

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

Tailwind configuration in `vite.config.js`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
})
```

Tailwind directives in `src/index.css`:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```
